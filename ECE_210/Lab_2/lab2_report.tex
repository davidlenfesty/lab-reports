    \section{Abstract}

    Various logic circuit designs can be combined together to create
    functional applications.

    Multiplexers and demultiplexers can be used to route specific
    incoming signals to a specified destination. In this lab a simulated
    digital signal from three different receivers was routed towards
    one of three "engineers".
    
    As well, logical elements can be used to design a simplistic access control system.
    In this lab such a circuit was designed and tested on an FPGA.

    \section{Introduction}

    The purpose of this lab was to design a simple Multiplexer and Demultiplexer circuit,
    as well as to design a circuit to control access to a lab.

    In order to validate the Multiplexer/Demultiplexer circuit,
    a useful circuit was designed using Xilinx Vivado software,
    and this circuit was simulated against the required inputs.

    In order to test the Lab Access Control circuit, the circuit was again designed
    using Xilinx Vivado, and simulated against required inputs.
    However, for this section, the design was also uploaded to a physical board
    where various inputs could be physically tested and validated.

    \section{Design Section}

    In order to design the following circuits, the Xilinx Vivado software
    was used to write VHDL that described the different logic circuits.

    \section{Procedure}
    In order to test that the circuit worked properly,
    both VHDL programs were simulated, and then the
    access control code was ran on a physical FPGA and verified physically,
    using buttons.

    The circuit for part one was tested using the supplied
    simulation file. The outputs were then verified against the expected truth table.

    For part two, the circuit was simulated and run against another
    supplied simulation file. It was also uploaded to an FPGA
    board, using the provided constraints, where the functionality
    of the access system was verified by using the physical buttons and switches on
    the board.


    \section{Results}

    \paragraph{Part 1}
    The VHDL design worked perfectly according to the specifications laid out.
    Below is the output from the simulation:

        \caption{Part 1 Simulation}
        \label{fig:part1_sim}
    \end{figure}

    \paragraph{Part 2}
    The VHDL design was able to correctly control the lab access and alarm signals
    as specified.
    Below is an image of the simulation waveform.

    Physical testing also proved to be correct.
